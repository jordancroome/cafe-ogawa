CAFE OGAWA WEBSITE FILES
========================

IMPORTANT: To view the website properly, you need to download ALL files to the SAME folder on your computer:

Required Files:
- cafe-ogawa.html (the main website file)
- cafe-ogawa-logo.svg (the logo)
- hero-ramen.jpg (hero section image)
- about-ramen.jpg (about section image)
- swirl-icon.svg (decorative swirl pattern)
- favicon.svg (browser tab icon)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download all 6 files listed above
2. Put them all in the same folder
3. Open cafe-ogawa.html in your web browser

The images won't display in the Claude.ai preview because they need to be in the same directory as the HTML file.

Alternatively, you can upload all files to a web hosting service and the website will work perfectly.
